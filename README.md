In order to get the chatbot working here are the commands that you can give it. Please note, that the commands have to be entered in order before it works.

Hi  
I would like to submit a ticket  
My email is fake@email.now  
I can't login  

## To-do list
The bot only works with English, and it is very basic, but possible improvements could be to improve the commands that it can respond to, and also make the chatbot take longer to reply, since now it feels like it is just that - a bot.
